Learning About Variables:
   Components of Variables - Name, Value and Types
       Name - is case sensitive and can start with letter or underscore. NOT IN NUMBERS.
            - only alphanumeric char and underscores (no other special chars).
            - suggestions : to spell it out and no shortcuts to maintain sanity :)

       Types - Numeric , Boolean, Strings
              Numeric can be both integers and float
              Boolean - T/F
              String - should be specified within quotes.
   LISTS -  uses square brackets  []  to denote a list.   
         - access elements of list , we can index,
         - each element has an index related to it depending on its position in the list.
         - get the value of the index using list[index]
         - IMP :INDICES STARTS with 0 (NOT 1)
         -To get the last element of a list, use the -1 index.

   LIST INDEX - strings can indexed, too! In fact, Python strings are really just lists of characters. Each character is given an index from zero to the length of the string.

For example, the string  language = "PYTHON" ,   language[2]  would give you T , because at index position 2 in the word "PYTHON" you find the character "T." Or, using inverse the index position, youwould use  language[-4]  to access  T .
A list of the following elements: P, Y, T, H, O, N. 
          the indices are indices: 0,1,2,3,4,5
        the inverse indices are  : -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1

LIST METHODS: append(),remove() ,sort(), len()
sort - alphabetically for lists of strings, and numerically for lists of numbers.

Tuples  are another Python structure that can be used to store data, although instead of brackets [], they are defined using parentheses ().

Ex - social_platforms_tuple = ("Facebook", "Instagram", "TikTok", "Twitter")
Many tuple properties are similar to those of a regular list. For example, both lists and tuples can be indexed. The main difference is that tuples are immutable (can't be modified), while lists are mutable (can be modified).
